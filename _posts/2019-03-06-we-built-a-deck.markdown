Long time no see. What have I been doing? Other things! I'll share some pictures of the deck we built.

## Pre-build

<div class="photo-section">
  <div class="photos">
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/missing_old_deck.jpg %}
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/supplies.jpg %}
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/excavating.jpg %}
  </div>
  <p>
    Some family friends came and removed our old deck. After just a year it was already splintering and falling apart. It was also too small, and was made with bad materials. We ended up replacing this ledger board since it was all marred up from the old deck. This also shows almost all the materials, and the excavation machine. I tried by hand and with an auger, but the home builder left far too many large rocks, and the excavator made short work of that.

## Build

<div class="photo-section">
  <div class="photos">
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/frame1.jpg %}
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/frame2.jpg %}
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/footings.jpg %}
  </div>
  <p>
    Once the holes were dug, we started work on the frame of the deck. We first laid out the upper frame and beam over where the footings were supposed to be, and then filled the footings with concrete. This made it a little harder to fill the tubes, but it made sure the deck was square before it was impossible to move them and let us get it level for the posts the beam rests of.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="photo-section">
  <div class="photos">
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/joists.jpg %}
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/decking.jpg %}
  </div>
  <p>
    With the frame complete, we could work on adding the joists and decking. We first attached the joists to the ledger board with the hangers, then nailed them to the rim joist. We could then add the hanger on the rim joist side for code. After the joists were in, we could start adding the decking boards. We used hidden fastners since we were using composite boards. They took a bit more effort and technique upfront, but the markless boards look great.

    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/railing1.jpg %}
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/railing2.jpg %}
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/railing3.jpg %}
  </div>
  <p>
    After all the decking was in place, we could attach the railings and balusters. This math was a little difficult to make sure we did not exceed four inches between the alusters, but had as similar as possible gaps for all sections. Since the balusters needed to span inconsistent sized sections, this took a little to convince ourselves the math was right.

## Post-build

<div class="photo-section">
  <div class="photos">
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/awning_brackets1.jpg %}
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/awning_brackets2.jpg %}
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/awning_on_ground.jpg %}
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/awning_unbalanced.jpg %}
  </div>
  <p>
    To shade ourselves during the summer heat, we added an awning overhead. Luckily, our family had just pulled one of their house, so we could recycle it on our own, and it matched. To mount the brackets, we needed to get some nylon spacers so we didn't need to remove the vinyl siding. We found a thickness that was slightly larger than the depth of our vinyl siding and mounting it towards the top of each piece so it would squeeze the siding as little as possible. After mounting the awning, it look a bit to actually get the awning balanced. Some set screws in the arms of the awning move each side up and down separately.

    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/deck_with_furniture2.jpg %}
    {% responsive_image path: _assets/images/deck/deck_with_furniture3.jpg %}
  </div>
  <p>
    The deck remained like this through the winter, and in the Spring we finally added furniture. We tried to match the furniture to the decking color since the awning and house took on the green color. We ended up moving the grill closer to the sliding door, but we kept the couch and sectional in those spots. We ended up adding extra padding to the sectionals pillows since they were incredibly lacking. Also, we added connectors to keep the sectional pieces together.

  <p>
    <b>Bonus!</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We added some lighting! I took an extension cord, cut it in half, wired it into an outdoor box and then plugged some lights from Target into the newly-switched extension cord. Adding this switch makes it match/make it just as easy to control the awning (it's powered in and out).

    We got hornets! This wasn't the only nest either. We had both yellow jackets AND bald face hornets. We ended up getting an exterminator to remove both nests since consumer spray didn't seem to be doing anything. They ended up getting in a full protection suit and spraying into the nest directly, ripping the nest out and spraying the remains. On the bright side, we haven't seen anything since!

    For Halloween 2021, I dressed up as The Blue Spirit from Avatar: The Last Airbender. It took a couple of years to make, partly due to COVID, partly due to needing to learn so many new things at once. I had made other costumes in the past with paper mache, but this time I was working with foam for the mask.
  </p>
  <p>
    I learned a lot by watching folks on YouTube, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EvilTedSmith" target="_blank">Evil Ted Smith</a>, who has a ton of tutorial videos on making all types of masks and helmets. The mask is actually mostly constructed out of floor mats (a common cheap, first-timer recommendation). There are multiple levels of finish on the mask to attempt to smooth out small imperfections, but I suspect had I started with true EVA foam, I wouldn't have needed as much effort here.

    The Blue Spirit isn't the Blue Spirit without his swords. I really wanted to make the "one sword that splits into two", and created two mirrored swords held together with magnets. They're thin plywood, cut and sanded into shape. Using some leather strips, paint and vinyl, I was able to get a pretty decent match to drawings I found online. There's a sheath as well, which holds the swords together, and matches a bit of the sword's guard.
  </p>

    Paired with a store bought "ninja uniform", we did a little photoshoot. I don't think the cats particularly liked me in the mask! I'm planning on building a piece of wall art to hang the mask and swords on, but haven't started that yet. Overall, it was a pretty fun project, and I love to look up from my desk at work to see the mask on display with my other masks.

    After what feels to me like a very short time, I've finished the sewing aspect of the storage bench for Gina's office. I didn't actually take very many progress shots because sewing doesn't really lend itself to that that well, but I did take a bunch of videos (very jankily) that I stitched into a timelapse of me making a pillow for the bench. I'll add that towards the end. If you haven't seen the woodworking portion of the project, head over to the <a href="https://tlunter.com/2020/01/27/office-bench/">prior post</a>.

    To start the project, we took a trip to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/bzyV28YPKm56GjCS7">Lorraine Fabrics</a> in Pawtucket to pick up the foam, fabric, batting and thread. We also went to Joann's to pick up the zipper since we needed just over two yards worth and Lorraine's didn't have any that long. We bought way too much material, but it worked out since we made two pillows out of the leftovers.

    These are pretty much the only "progress" shots I have. This one is from just before sewing while I was pinning the first panel on. The first sew is always the hardest, just like any other project. After the first one, it all moved along pretty quickly. The only thing that really slowed me down were the zippers.

    The zippers were a complete show stopper for me. Zippers require using a different foot for the machine to actually get close enough to the stitch line. Fortunately for us, the machine we own came with one. Unfortunately, I had a bit of difficulty and hadn't practiced before the real thing at all. After watching a few YouTube videos, I just decided to go for it. I kept having issues with the thread tension, the bobbin, running out of thread on the bobbin, or the zipper just slipping off the center of the seam. The idea is that you sew the zipper over prior sewn seam and pop the stitches on that one to reveal the zipper with nice seams. Since the zipper we bought had a bit of fabric on the back, it kept slipping away from the zipper foot. After a very upsetting night, I woke up the next morning far more motivated, finished the zipper... and found out the panel was too short. Since the zipper didn't move as much as the fabric (feed dogs don't help with thick fabric and zipper), it was bunched up throughout and useless. I ran down to Joann Fabric's, cut more panels out of the scraps and re-did it all. The panel was again(!) too short, but this time rather than re-do it, I just added a gusset on one end. The zipper is on the back side where no one can see it anyway.

    After the double mess up on the zipper, I almost ran out of thread. I ran to the store (again), and was able to finish the sewing.

    The foam pad had hard edges, but we didn't really want that look. We also wanted the cushion to always be pushing slightly against the cover so it didn't look loose. We added and glued the batting onto the foam pad so it was a bit thicker and didn't slide around underneath. We had some <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/100067550">3M 77 Spray Adhesive</a> lying around from a cat furniture project, and that worked well. It was gross outside, so we did it in the house on some cardboard, but ended up having to open the door anyway to get rid of the smell. After letting that air out and dry, we put it in the finished cover.

    With all the pieces together, we could finally see how it all looked. The fabric color really went well with the wall and valance, so we were very happy. Cow (one of our cats) also really likes hanging out with us on the bench. One of her new spots to terrorize!

    Here is a extremely (50x?) sped up video of me putting together the big pillow for the bench with the left over fabric. We did actually buy new fabric from Lorraine's for the back to change it up a little, but it was remnants, so only cost us $7 for two and a half yards of fabric. Cut from this version is the ten minutes of me trying to find the start of that first spool of thread! Please ignore the mouse cursor early on.
